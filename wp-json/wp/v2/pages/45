We guarantee that all vaccinations and wormings have been given as stated on the vaccination schedule, which you will receive alongside your puppy. The buyer should have this puppy examined by a licensed veterinarian of their choice. If this puppy is found to have a life threatening hereditary congenital defect or any major health at this exam, a full refund will be given, provided that the seller is notified within 48 hours after the exam. This puppy must be returned to the breeder along with the AKC registration papers within 72 hours, at no expense to the customer, with a signed document from the licensed veterinarian stating the defect or problem.<\/p>\n<p>This puppy is warranted for 2 years from the date of purchase against fatal and life altering congenital disease which adversely affects the health of the animal. This includes severe hip dysplasia which hampers a dog\u2019s movement and natural gait, kidney, heart, pancreas, spine, and liver problems of a severe life threatening or altering nature. If the dog dies within the two year time frame the buyer will pay to have a necropsy done to ascertain cause of death. The breeder must be notified within 48 hours and be given the option of having a necropsy done by breeder&#8217;s vet. If reason is congenital, the breeder will refund the purchase price.<\/p>\n<p>In case dog shows defect within two years of purchase. Breeder must be notified of the problem within 2 business days of the licensed veterinarian\u2019s determination and have two reports from two unassociated veterinarians stating the same problem and breeder will provide a full refund. A puppy with a defect must be returned to the breeder to qualify for a refund. Breeder will not be responsible for any medical expenses incurred. Buyer is aware that owning a puppy means trips to the veterinarian and understands that he\/she will be responsible for all payments. A returned puppy must be returned to the breeder in good condition, other than the specified problem. No refund on puppy will be given if the puppy has been euthanized without breeder\u2019s permission.<\/p>\n<p>Proper care of your new puppy is a must. Tiny puppies need to eat frequently in small amounts to maintain proper blood sugar levels. A drop in blood sugar can cause hypoglycemia and can be fatal.<\/p>\n<p>If for any reason the puppy does not work out for you, or if your life changes such that you are unable to provide this puppy with a happy home, please call us! We are always willing to take the puppy\/dog back to secure a new home for him\/her.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We guarantee that your puppy is purebred.
