So the learning process has been going on for quite a few years for us now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you show your dogs?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe recently started showing at APRI dog shows. These shows are a lot of fun, and the competitors are friends and fellow breeders. The cut throat attitude and politics that dominates AKC shows is simply not to our liking, We have just never been able to deal with people that think they are better than everyone else. we not so jokingly tell people, \u201cour dogs are fine, it\u2019s us that bite!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you offer service after the sale?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes! As long time breeders and dog lovers we have a lot of useful advice we can offer our customers. Help with the care of the new pup, and later, training, house breaking, etc. We like to keep in touch with the new owners of my pups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will the puppy have had it&#8217;s shots?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes. Your puppy will come with a complete health record of all the vaccinations and wormings it has had. We normally give at least 2 shots, including one straight parvo shot, using Neopar, the best parvo vaccine available, and a combination shot. However, many vets recommend that a pup receive regular booster shots until at least 4 months of age, so you will need to continue the shots as recommended by your veterinarian, according to what problems are prevalent in your area. We also use a variety of different wormers to control this problem in pups, but please remember, this too is something that needs to be continued after you purchase your pup. Most of the wormers available only work on adult worms, and leave the larva to re-infest the dog, so frequent worming is very important to the health of your pet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I get my puppy micro chipped?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes. Just drop us a line and mention it, and we can take care of it for you and send you all the paperwork to register your chip.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are your puppies registered?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes, we use America&#8217;s Pet Registry, or United All Breed Registry for our pups, as well as AKC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are your puppies socialized?<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is one of the most important (and fun!) parts of our job, when raising pups that will grow up to be beloved family members. The pups are handled daily. As they develop, they are exposed to different situations that teach them new experiences, and help them grow and learn. We never wean our pups young, pups learn a great deal from their mothers, and interaction with litter-mates helps them be well rounded, mentally stable individuals later in life. Some people have the mistaken idea that pups should be raised in a home, and not a kennel. This is simply not true. Kennels are designed for safety and cleanliness of dogs, which is also very important in raising healthy pups. And the sights and sounds in a kennel are hardly any different than in a house. Our pups learn the sound of the microwave bell going off, the sounds of vacuum sweeper, radio, opening and closing of the refrigerator door, human conversations, lights going off and on, and all the other sounds normally found in any home. The design of the kennel, with an indoor area and an outside run, actually promotes early housebreaking in pups, whereas raising pups in a house encourages them to eliminate in a house, unlike a kennel where they quickly learn to \u201cgo outside\u201d to do their business. And besides, if they were our my house, they would never see us, We spend nearly all our time at the kennel, the house is just a place to sleep and keep my stuff!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you ship?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes, We now use an excellent professional service to transport our pups Nation wide where our pups can get much better connections to make their trips to their new homes much less stressful. These folks do a great job of taking care of the pups while in transport, since they too are breeders and know all about the care required for my pups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is shipping safe\/stressful for the pup?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe airlines have a very good track record when it comes to taking care of pups. They ship hundreds of pups every week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can we call you?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes, if you must! \ud83d\ude42 We prefer to handle most of my business through email. It seems that the telephone only rings here on occasions, during dinner or sleeping. It is also sometimes difficult to catch us in the house. When you choose to raise dogs, you have to work according to their schedule, not yours. We long ago gave up having any &#8220;set&#8221; hours. we may be up all night helping deliver a new litter, or have gotten up at 3am to deliver a pup to the airport, so if we are still in bed at the crack of noon, it sure isn&#8217;t because we are lazy!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS How long have you been raising dogs?
