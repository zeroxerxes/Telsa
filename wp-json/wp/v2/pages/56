We have had our baby Murphy for a week now, and I can&#8217;t tell you enough how much we love him! He learned to sit on command by the 2nd day, and is so eager to learn and please. Our Vet could not believe how mellow he is for such a young puppy. We spent the weekend with our 2-year-old nephew and Murphy seemed to know he was a baby, and never jumped up on him! All of this, tells us that he came to us well socialized! Again, I highly recommend anyone looking for a &#8220;puppy&#8221;, look no further than Galaxy Dachshunds!<br \/>\n~Richard~<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-927 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/John-Theresa-Testimonial.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"219\" height=\"150\" \/>Hi, my husband, and I was looking for my Christmas gift. And we decided to get a new puppy. What better than a Chihuahua =}. We then came across the Galaxy puppies website, and we also had the chance to talk with the breeder himself. Please let me start by saying. That anyone who might be interested in getting a chihuahua this is a good legal website to go to. Not only is a good one but also they are good breeders and very responsible for all their puppies as well. And any questions you might have they will know. And when they ship out our little one. They did an awesome job. We received our new puppy in a new clean crate and very secure. We all are very happy =} with our new member of our family. Zoe is and always will be our pride and joy. :} Thank You!<br \/>\n~Grindstaff Family~<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: inherit; background-color: transparent; color: inherit; font-family: var(--body_font_family, sans-serif);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: inherit; font-family: var(--body_font_family, sans-serif); font-size: inherit;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-1128 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screenshot-2021-02-11-005031-263x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"152\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screenshot-2021-02-11-005031-263x300.png 263w, https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screenshot-2021-02-11-005031.png 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" \/>I just wanted to let you know that Neutyn is doing very well. He is as mischievous as ever. He is biting and attacking my feet as I write. He has been home for almost three weeks now. After the loss of our Yorkie, Justice, Neutyn has filled the air with a personality and flare that only a bulldog can. I know that he will never replace Justice, but he is also irreplaceable. We are in the process of spoiling him rotten. He often shares my pillows on the bed at night. I hate to tell him that he will get too big, and they are my pillows and not his. He thinks that he is the king when he can get up on the bed all by himself (good thing he has a ramp). Thank you both so much for everything that you have done to bring us together with Neutyn. We love him dearly.\u00a0 \u00a0~Jeb~<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1126  alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image_2021-02-11_005254.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image_2021-02-11_005254.png 196w, https:\/\/galaxydachshunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image_2021-02-11_005254-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" \/><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: inherit; font-family: var(--body_font_family, sans-serif);\">Hello,<\/span><br \/>\nMe and my boyfriend bought a puppy last Saturday and I just wanted to let you know how she was doing.
